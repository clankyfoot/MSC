    <h3>Welcome to our Frequently Asked Questions page</h3>

            <h3>Is Ski Jumping Dangerous</h3>
            <p>Ski jumping, like most other sports, comes with a risk. That’s why at the Minneapolis Ski Club our coaches focus on working with athletes and getting them best prepared for the next jump or event. We also focus on having the right equipment for the job, which makes it safer for you!</p>

            <h3>How how do you actually jump?</h3>
            <p>Most of the work is really done by the jump itself. Skiers are started off at our smallest hill and then gradually moved up each level until they’re ready for the big time. All of the jumps are actually angled downward which launches the skier. It’s up to our coaches’ excellent training and our increased reaction time that you learn when the best time is to jump off of the in-run.</p>

            <h3>How <em>high</em> do you jump?</h3>
            <p>Ski jumpers actually don’t jump that high. In fact, they’re almost thrown at the hill. When they go off the jump they are only a couple of meters off of the surface of the snow while they glide down to victory!</p>

            <h3>How old do you have to be to ski jump?</h3>
            <p>There’s no discrimination here: you’re willing to be committed to the training, you aren’t afraid of taking on fun challenges, you’re willing to work with our overqualified coaches, and you’ve got a pulse – we’ll take you!</p>

            <h3>Is there jumping during he summer?</h3>
            <p>Yes, ski jumping is a year round sport. The same jumps that are used in the winter can be outfitted with plastic material that is wet with a light coat of water. The plastic provides a perfect surface to ski on. The in-run is outfitted with tracks that a jumpers ski’s fit into creating a smooth ride with speeds that can be faster than snow.</p>

            <h3>What happens to events and training whent here is no, or little snow?</h3>
            <p>In the winter of 2011-2012 we had little to no snow. We brought in snow by dump trucks to build up the hills. The MSC is one tough and determined cookie. But in the event that there is absolutely no snow, or there is a blizzard, you’ll be notified if the event or training is off.</p>
