            <h3>Become a member</h3>
            <p>Sign up your skiers to establish your family as full members of the Minneapolis Ski Club. Members are granted eligibility in competitions, traveling to comps, and to be part of a great ski team!

                Below are some forms to fill out to become a member. Come out to try it at one of our practice times – equipment is of limited supply, but when you become a member, your equipment is guaranteed! Members also get a pretty sweet deal at the concession stand as well, as there are club member discounts.

            <h3>Determining Skill level</h3>
            <p>s
                We do not require any previous experience on skis. However, experience with alpine skiing, cross country skiing, snowboarding or ice skating helps an individual progress at a faster rate. The coaches will ask questions about previous skiing experience and determine the best place to start.
                All jumpers start on our smallest hill. A skier moves to the next level when they develop the appropriate skills and confidence.
